    <h2>New Collaboration with Eleni Foureira</h2>
    <p>Eurovision 2018 runner-up Eleni Foureira has teamed up with international star Claydee on this summer smash “Loquita”. This sultry inviting reggaeton beats will seduce the ear of any listener and send you “Loquita” for more! The video is equally sultry with Eleni doing her usual on point choreography that climaxes to Eleni taking to a fountain to dance in! Clearly, she needed cooling down from all that sultry dancing!



        Claydee and Eleni are no strangers, they performed together in 215 MAD TV Awards alongside Austalian-Lebanese artist Faydee and BO.
        
        Claydee, like Eleni was born in Albania and moved to Greece at a young age. He is an established music artist in Greece and Cyprus alongside other territories Spain, Russia, Poland and his native Albania.
        
        “Claydee Lupa” is a talented young songwriter/producer based in Athens, Greece. He lives for his music and this does not come unnoticed in his tracks, which is why he is working with some of the top and most respected artists in Europe. He made a great impact in the European music scene with his major hit “The End” by Reckless and followed his success with “Last Summer” by Nicko and “Call me” which all three became instant hits within 6 months of their release. His name and/or work can be found in almost every chart in Europe and he is the most requested producer in Greece. Quality comes second to none and Claydee lives, breathes, and represents this in every way possible, from his music, to his everyday life. He has recently applied the above in a newly formed production group going by the name of “BEETKRAFT” which aims to deliver the best possible productions for specific quality projects and artists based both in Greece and worldwide.
        
        Eleni Foureira was born in 1987 in Albania and is a pop singer and actress. She started her solo career in 2010 with the release of her first album. Dubbed the ‘Queen of Pop’, the singer has had several successes in both Greece and Cyprus. Eleni’s song Chica Bomb, a collaboration with Dan Balan, became a summer hit in 2010. In 2014 Eleni appeared at the Mad Video Music Awards alongside J Balvin, singer of the hit Tranquila, which is about to surpass 100,000,000 views on YouTube. In recent years Eleni has released singles in both Greek and English and in 2017 scored a new international hit with the song Send For Me, a collaboration with successful producer and rapper A.M. SNiPE. In addition to her musical career, Eleni has also been a judge on the Greek version of So You Think You Can Dance. She has also toured extensively in the Balkans and worked in the fashion industry. Her performance at the 2014 edition of the MAD Video Music Awards received over 11 million views on YouTube.</p>
